/**
 * Fetches assertion packs by URL and verifies each against a pinned digest.
 *
 * <p>A pack is executable SQL arriving over a network, which is remote code
 * execution by design. Three things follow, and all three are enforced here
 * rather than left to a deployment:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>The digest is required and checked before the bytes are parsed.</b>
 *     Not after: a store is JSON, and parsing attacker-controlled JSON to find
 *     out whether it is the right JSON has the order backwards.
 * <li><b>No {@code latest}.</b> A pinned digest is what makes a run
 *     reproducible; a mutable tag makes "which assertions produced this report"
 *     unanswerable, which is the whole cost packs are meant to avoid.
 * <li><b>A token is never in the URL.</b> Private packs take an Authorization
 *     header supplied by configuration, because a URL ends up in logs.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@code file:} URLs are accepted deliberately: it is how the shared-volume
 * layout works today, how a developer tests a pack before publishing it, and
 * how this class is tested without a network.
 *
 * <p>Two details are what a GitHub release asset needs, and both were wrong
 * until a private pack was actually fetched:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>{@code Accept: application/octet-stream}.</b> Asked for
 *     {@code application/json}, the GitHub API returns the asset's METADATA -
 *     a JSON object describing the file - rather than the file. That fails the
 *     digest check, so it fails safe, but it never succeeds either.
 * <li><b>Redirects are followed.</b> The API answers 302 to a
 *     release-assets host, and {@code HttpClient}'s default is
 *     {@code Redirect.NEVER}, so the fetch died on "returned HTTP 302". The
 *     Authorization header is carried across, which that host requires.
 * </ul>
