/**
 * Unzips a release for {@link DuckMaterialiser}, applying the same file
 * selection the MySQL loader applies.
 *
 * <p>The acquisition step hands over ZIPs; the materialiser reads a DIRECTORY.
 * Something has to bridge that, and the temptation is to write three lines of
 * unzip. This class exists because those three lines would quietly drop two
 * behaviours that decide which files a validation sees:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>One flat folder.</b> {@code ReleaseDataManager} extracts every release
 *     type into a single directory with
 *     {@code ZipFileUtils.extractFilesFromZipToOneFolder}, so delta, snapshot
 *     and full sit side by side. The same call is used here rather than
 *     snomedboot's {@code unzipRelease}, which takes ONE {@code ImportType} and
 *     would silently give the engines different inputs from the same package.
 * <li><b>Exclusions, expanded.</b> {@code excludedRF2Files} is honoured by the
 *     MySQL loader and was ignored entirely by the DuckDB path - so a file a run
 *     had deliberately excluded was validated anyway, and reported findings
 *     against content the caller had said to leave out.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The exclusion rule is reproduced exactly, quirks included, because a rule
 * that is nearly the same is worse than one that is different: it agrees on
 * every case anyone tests and diverges on the one nobody does. Specifically
 * ({@code ReleaseDataManager.isExcludedFile} and {@code loadReleaseFilesToDB}):
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>excluding a DELTA file also excludes the matching Full and Snapshot -
 *     both the {@code Delta_} and {@code Delta-} spellings, the second being the
 *     language-suffixed files;
 * <li>a candidate has any leading {@code x} stripped, then {@code sct2} and
 *     {@code der2} are both normalised to {@code rel2}, so a package's own
 *     naming does not have to match the exclusion's;
 * <li>the exclusion entry has its {@code _YYYYMMDD.txt} suffix removed and is
 *     then matched with {@code contains}, not equality - it is a prefix rule
 *     wearing a substring rule's clothes.
 * </ol>
