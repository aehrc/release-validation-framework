/**
 * Materialised copies of releases that do not change between runs, so a nightly
 * stops rebuilding the same previous release every night.
 *
 * <p>A nightly validates a fresh export against the last published release, and
 * for a monthly product that previous release is identical for about thirty
 * consecutive runs. Measured on the AU edition, materialising it costs 21-25s of
 * a 257s run - so this is worth roughly 8%, and it removes the last piece of
 * per-run rework rather than being the thing that makes a nightly affordable.
 * The prospective release is never cached: it is different every night by
 * definition.
 *
 * <h2>Read-only ATTACH, and why the layout matters</h2>
 *
 * <p>A cached release is attached, not copied in:
 * {@code ATTACH '<file>' AS previous (READ_ONLY)}. That works because the store's
 * sentinels resolve {@code <PREVIOUS>} to the bare literal {@code previous}, and
 * DuckDB resolves a two-part {@code previous.concept_s} against an attached
 * catalogue's default schema. So a cached file MUST hold its tables in
 * {@code main}: with them in a schema called {@code previous},
 * {@code previous.concept_s} does not resolve and only
 * {@code previous.previous.concept_s} does - verified, and the reason
 * {@link #MAIN} is what gets materialised here.
 *
 * <p>Safe for a pool of workers because nothing writes to a cached file after it
 * is built. DuckDB permits many readers OR one writer and refuses everything
 * else - a process holding a file read-write locks out even read-only openers -
 * so the build happens on a temporary name and is published by an atomic rename.
 * A reader therefore only ever sees a complete file.
 *
 * <h2>The fingerprint is not the filename</h2>
 *
 * <p>Keying on a release name would be wrong twice over. A release republished
 * under the same name would hit a stale cache; and a cached file is only valid
 * for the {@code tableColumns} map that built it, because
 * {@link DuckMaterialiser} loads some tables POSITIONALLY where the shipped
 * columns disagree with the declared ones. Change the store and the same bytes
 * load differently. So the key is a digest of the release's own shape - every
 * RF2 filename and its size - together with a digest of the column map. A
 * mismatch misses and rebuilds instead of loading silently wrong data.
